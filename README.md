# sloane-name-generator

A Clojure app to generate your Sloane name, from a tweet by Tattler magazine

http://www.tatler.com/news/articles/july-2015/sloane-name-generator

Take the first leter of your first name and find the corresponding name from the first list.  Then take your first name from your surname and find the matching sloane name.  Finally, take the second letter from your surname and find the maching 3rd sloane name.

To make it even sillier, take random letters from your first & last names to create your Sloane name.

Alternatively, create a hipster name generator along the same lines.
